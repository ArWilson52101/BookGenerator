# BookGenerator
Python script that generates books automatically using openrouter api to send prompts to LLMs

you can change the font to whatever but i find that the one i have on by default is the best

This project resparked my love for programming so I hope it can inspire you to do something that you like too.

feel free to use it as you like, change the prompts to be the same, add an input, the world is your oyster.

# **Requirements**
Python 3.x
requests
fpdf2

# **setup**
get an API key from openrouter and replace the api_key in the variable with your key (keep the "Bearer" part in though)

Run the program.

This will generate a title and genre, create a plot outline, write each chapter, then export it to pdf.
